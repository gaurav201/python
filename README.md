This repository aims to be a portfolio of my work during the 'Applied Data Science With Python' specialization held by the University of Michigan on Coursera. It also serves me as a quick reminder of some awesome tricks that I have used for data cleaning and analysis.

A big thank you to Professor Cristopher Brooks of the University of Michigan. Thanks for creating a data science specialization that guides the student to find his own tools for solving real data science problems!

The specialization consists of the following courses:

    Introduction to Data Science in Python
    Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
    Applied Machine Learning in Python
    Applied Text Mining in Python
    Applied Social Network Analysis in Python


Course 2: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

This course introduced me to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. The course started with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. It also introduced me to the best practices when creating new charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework.

To pass this course, I had to complete 3 assignments. Here is a short description of the last assignment:

    Becoming an independent data scientist

This assignment required to identify at least two publicly accessible datasets that are consistent across a meaningful dimension. I had to state a research question that can be answered using these datasets and then create a visual using matplotlib that addresses the stated research question. I also had to justify how the visual addresses my research question. As this assignment was for the whole course, I had to incorporate and defend the principles discussed in the first week and align with Cairoâ€™s principles of truth, beauty, function, and insight.
